0. Go into xxx/reviewTable/src
1. compile the file by the command ‘javac ProduceBlankNote.java’ in your terminal application
2. run this file to produce new blank enex files by the command ‘java -cp . ProduceBlankNote’
3. import all new produced enex files into your evernote
4. merge all your new notes into one table note to get note urls, then expert it(it may use last years urls, do the same); When I use evernote international version, it should use 'copy internal app links' to get the note urls
5. create one new file in urls dir, clip the content from before step result into it(remove old ones after copied new ones)
6. compile and run ‘ReviewEvernote.java’
7. import plans into evernote.

As I do not review, I do not fix the bugs in international version.
